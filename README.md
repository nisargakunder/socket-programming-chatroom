# socket-programming-chatroom
THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A SIMPLE CHAT ROOM APPLICATIONS WHICH ALLOWS DIFFERENT USERS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER THROUGH A CONNECTED SERVER
I HAVE IMPLEMENTED THIS USING PYTHON.IT IS GOING TO BE A MULTI CLIENT APPLICATION WHICH ENABLES MULTIPLE CLIENTS TO CONNECT TO THE SERVER SIMULTANEOUSLY.  
A SOCKET IS SET UP ON EACH END WHICH ALLOWS A CLIENT TO INTERACT WITH OTHER CLIENTS VIA THE SERVER.THE SERVER IS GOING TO BE A CONCURRENT SERVER .
EACH CLIENT IS HANDLED BY A SEPARATE THREAD,WHICH HELPS THE SERVER TO HANDLE MULTIPLE CLIENTS.EVERY TIME A USER CONNECTS,A SEPARATE THREAD WILL BE CREATED FOR THAT USER.
IN EACH THREAD SERVER AWAITS A MESSAGE AND SENDS THAT MESSAGE TO OTHER USERS CURRENTLY ON THE CHAT. THIS IS HOW A SIMPLE COOL MULTIPLE CLIENTS CHAT APPLICATION IS BUILT TO KEEP UP  SECRETS BETWEEM YOUR FRINDS LOCKED IN A ROOM!!
